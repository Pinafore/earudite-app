when

00:1.180 --> 00:1.260
i

00:1.300 --> 00:1.510
took

00:1.510 --> 00:1.900
office

00:1.910 --> 00:1.980
in

00:1.980 --> 00:2.060
the

00:2.070 --> 00:2.470
midst

00:2.470 --> 00:2.580
of

00:2.580 --> 00:2.600
the

worst

00:2.980 --> 00:3.420
recession

00:3.420 --> 00:3.640
since

00:3.640 --> 00:3.720
the

depression

00:4.870 --> 00:4.970
i

00:4.970 --> 00:5.360
promised

00:5.360 --> 00:5.430
you

00:5.430 --> 00:5.630
two

00:5.630 --> 00:6.080
things

00:6.710 --> 00:6.850
the

00:6.850 --> 00:7.390
first

00:7.440 --> 00:7.700
was

00:7.710 --> 00:7.770
that

00:7.780 --> 00:7.920
there

00:7.920 --> 00:8.050
would

00:8.060 --> 00:8.190
be

00:8.190 --> 00:8.440
better

00:8.440 --> 00:8.670
days

00:8.670 --> 00:8.980
ahead

00:9.550 --> 00:9.670
in

00:9.670 --> 00:9.740
the

00:9.740 --> 00:10.080
second

00:10.090 --> 00:10.370
was

00:10.380 --> 00:10.590
the

00:10.590 --> 00:10.850
road

00:10.850 --> 00:10.950
to

00:10.950 --> 00:11.410
recovery

00:11.410 --> 00:11.570
would

00:11.580 --> 00:11.720
be

00:11.720 --> 00:12.080
long

00:12.420 --> 00:12.550
and

00:12.550 --> 00:12.980
sometimes

00:12.980 --> 00:13.360
bumpy

00:14.270 --> 00:14.470
was

00:14.470 --> 00:14.680
brought

00:14.680 --> 00:15.030
home

00:15.080 --> 00:15.360
again

00:15.360 --> 00:15.920
yesterday

00:16.310 --> 00:16.510
we

00:16.510 --> 00:16.780
learned

00:16.790 --> 00:16.930
that

00:16.930 --> 00:17.050
in

00:17.050 --> 00:17.620

first

00:19.450 --> 00:19.790

00:20.620 --> 00:20.820
in

00:20.820 --> 00:21.170
nearly

00:21.170 --> 00:21.370
two

00:21.370 --> 00:21.830
years

00:22.370 --> 00:22.540

00:23.460 --> 00:23.790
lost

00:23.800 --> 00:24.020
more

00:24.020 --> 00:24.150
than

00:24.150 --> 00:24.250
we

00:24.250 --> 00:24.620
gained

00:25.230 --> 00:25.460
now

00:25.460 --> 00:25.570
we

00:25.570 --> 00:25.720
know

00:25.720 --> 00:25.860
that

00:25.860 --> 00:26.000

00:27.990 --> 00:28.460
losses

00:28.460 --> 00:28.610
for

00:28.610 --> 00:28.680
the

00:28.680 --> 00:28.990
final

00:29.000 --> 00:29.300

what

00:32.110 --> 00:32.280
they

00:32.280 --> 00:32.690
were

until

00:34.740 --> 00:34.940
we

00:34.940 --> 00:35.270
see

00:35.290 --> 00:35.440
a

00:38.450 --> 00:38.630
we

00:38.630 --> 00:38.790
will

00:38.800 --> 00:39.020
be

00:39.020 --> 00:39.680
relentless

our

00:39.950 --> 00:40.390
efforts

00:40.570 --> 00:40.710
to

00:40.710 --> 00:40.940

00:43.390 --> 00:43.600
even

00:43.600 --> 00:43.950
deeper

00:43.950 --> 00:44.120
than

00:44.120 --> 00:44.600
replacing

00:45.760 --> 00:45.900
been

00:45.900 --> 00:46.200

two

00:46.860 --> 00:47.310
years

00:47.830 --> 00:47.990
we

00:47.990 --> 00:48.140
need

recession

00:64.840 --> 00:65.090
long

was

00:73.140 --> 00:73.430
easy

00:74.020 --> 00:74.110
in

00:74.110 --> 00:74.200
the

00:74.200 --> 00:74.590
result

00:74.610 --> 00:74.810
was

00:74.810 --> 00:74.880
an

00:74.880 --> 00:75.410
economy

00:75.410 --> 00:75.710
where

made

00:76.390 --> 00:76.540
out

00:76.540 --> 00:76.850
well
